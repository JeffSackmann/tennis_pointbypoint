# Duplicate Check

In a few instances, point-by-point scores are entered multiple times for a match. I have flagged these instances and used flashscore.com as an independent check when there was a discrepancy in entries. When point-by-point data was not available on flashscore.com, the match summary statistics on the tour website was reviewed and summary stats on break points, return points, etc. were used to identify the correct score. When match summary stats were not available, the score was reviewed an an assessment was made as to which appeared more plausible (i.e. fewer streaks, etc.). 

Based on this review process, the correctness of each score was classified using the following classification scheme:

1 = Correct with no aces/double faults noted

2 = Correct with aces/double faults noted

3 = Incorrect

4 = Uncertain

5 = Uncertain but suspected incorrect

6 = No record of match in external sources 


The review process also revealed some instances where matches were designated as "Main" but appear to be "Qualifying" matches based on external sources (tour sites, etc.). An indicator is included in the "duplicates_corrections.xls" for qualifying matches. However, this would only be a subset of the possible incorrect entries on qualifying status of matches involving duplicate matches and not all entered matches.
